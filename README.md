# Inverse-ResNet-101

This repository contains the implementation of a novel, inverted version of the ResNet-101 architecture. Further, the ResNet-101 and its inverse are cascaded to form an autoencoder, which is trained on the [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) Dataset for query matching applications.
